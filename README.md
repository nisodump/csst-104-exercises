# CSST 104: Advance Machine Learning Exercises
This repository contains my exercises and projects for the subject CSST 104 - Advanced Machine Learning.

## Table of Contents
1. <a href="https://github.com/nisodump/csst-104-exercises/tree/main/Exercise-5">Exercise 5 - Bank Customer</a>
    - Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and account information using logistic regression.
2. <a href="https://github.com/nisodump/csst-104-exercises/tree/main/Exercise-6">Exercise 6 - Predicting Feedback on Online Food Orders Using Logistic Regression</a>
    - Develop a logistic regression model to predict the customer feedback (positive/negative) on online food orders. This task involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.
3. <a href="https://github.com/nisodump/csst-104-exercises/tree/main/Exercise-7">Exercise 7 - Netflix Userbase Analysis</a>
    - Leverage linear regression to predict Monthly Revenue and logistic regression to classify customers based on a positive or negative feedback proxy, using the Netflix Userbase dataset. This task will encompass data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.
4. <a href="https://github.com/nisodump/csst-104-exercises/tree/main/Exercise-8">Exercise 8 - Pollution Data Time Series Analysis Using ARIMA</a>
    - The goal of this assessment is to simulate a time series dataset representing a country's annual pollution levels over a decade. You will apply time series analysis techniques, including the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to understand the data's behavior, test for stationarity, and forecast future pollution levels.
5. <a href="https://github.com/nisodump/csst-104-exercises/tree/main/Midterm">Midterm - Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with ARIMA Model</a>
    - To apply ARIMA modeling techniques to forecast the number of app updates in the Google Play Store for the next 12 months based on historical data.
